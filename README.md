# FaceMind
Emotion Recognition based on Deep Learning explores AI models that interpret human emotions from facial expressions, voice, and text. By investigating neural networks, training methods, and datasets, the research aims for real-time, accurate emotion recognition, with applications in mental health, human-computer interaction.

The strategy involves combining deep learning techniques and MMPI test to yield better emotion recognition.
The Key steps involved are:
  Data Collection: Gather diverse datasets containing labeled binary data from the questionnaire. 
  Model Selection: Choose appropriate deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs , LLMâ€™s ) for each data modality.
  Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Apply preprocessing techniques and feature extraction to convert raw data into suitable input formats.
  Training and Evaluation: Train models on the prepared data, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and evaluate performance.
