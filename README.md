# Emotion Recognition Based on Deep Learning

This project explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human emotions through deep learning models. The aim is to accurately interpret human emotions from facial expressions, voice tonality, and text sentiment analysis using cutting-edge neural network architectures.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- **Real-time Emotion Recognition**: Implementing models to recognize emotions in real time from facial expressions, voice data, and text sentiment.
- **Deep Learning Architectures**: Investigating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial recognition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for voice data, and transformer models like BERT for text analysis.
- **Applications**: This system has potential applications in mental health, human-computer interaction, and consumer behavior insights.
