Key Steps Involved
Data Collection
Collect diverse datasets containing labeled binary data from questionnaires (e.g., MMPI test) and real-world emotion data (facial, voice, and text).

Model Selection
Select appropriate deep learning architectures, such as CNNs and LLMs, for processing each data modality.

Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
Apply preprocessing techniques to clean raw data and extract features suitable for model input.

Training & Evaluation
Train the models on preprocessed data, fine-tune hyperparameters, and evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy and speed.

Strategy
Combining deep learning techniques with the MMPI test enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of emotion recognition models, leading to better real-world applications and insights.
